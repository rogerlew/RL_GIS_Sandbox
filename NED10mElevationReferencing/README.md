# NED 10m Elevation Referencing 

This code provides elevation referencing from locally stored or network mapped 
georeferenced Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) stored in ESRI raster datasets.

Functionality is similiar to Google's Elevation API except it runs locally using
local digital elevation maps (not provided here).

Elevation interpolation between raster points can be specified as 'nearest',
'bilinear' or 'cubic'
