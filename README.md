# Roger's GIS Sandbox

This repository contains projects related to the visualization of
geospatial datasets.

## Elevation Referencing Service
This code provides elevation referencing from locally stored or network mapped 
georeferenced Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) stored in ESRI raster datasets.

## isnobal
ISNOBAL (in all caps) is an energy and mass-balance snow model. It operates on
gridded data, and the inputs and outputs of ISNOBAL are multiband raster datasets
in an "IPW" format. This provides functionality for reading and processing these
datasets.

## WEPPout
The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) models precipitation, runoff, and
erosion at the subcatchment level using hillslopes derived from TOPAZ. This
module provides functionality for reading the text outputs to hd5.
