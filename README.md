## Elevation Referencing Service
This code provides elevation referencing from locally stored or network mapped 
georeferenced Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) stored in ESRI raster datasets.

Functionality is similiar to Google's Elevation API except it runs locally.

Elevation interpolation between raster points can be specified as 'nearest',
'bilinear' or 'cubic'
